# 🖤 Obsidian — Brand One-Pager

## 1. Brand Essence
**Mission**  
> We restore order to the revenue pipeline — helping teams recover what they’ve already earned.

**Why We Exist**  
CRM chaos costs more than anyone admits. Obsidian exists to bring precision, ownership, and discipline back to revenue operations.

**Core Principles**
- **Discipline > Hustle**
- **Outcome > Noise**
- **Signal > Vanity**

**Brand Feel**  
A force of nature — intelligent, restrained, precise. Think volcanic glass: formed under pressure, razor-sharp, naturally strong.

## 2. Positioning Statement
**For** revenue and operations leaders buried under messy CRM data,  
**Obsidian** is the discipline layer that turns noise into actionable clarity —  
using explainable signals, CRM-native enforcement, and human-grade insights to help teams recover hidden revenue.  

Unlike automation-heavy tools that optimize tasks, **we optimize truth**.

- Deep Teal pairs well with Signal Amber for contrast in visualizations
- Crimson Alert should only be used for critical errors/alerts
